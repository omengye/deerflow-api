"""Built-in tool for on-demand discovery of uploaded files.

The uploads middleware only injects metadata for files attached to the current
message.  Files uploaded earlier in the thread are announced as a bare name
list, so the model uses this tool to fetch their details when a question
actually calls for them.  A bare listing call (no ``filename``) returns only
name/size/path for every file -- document outlines are extracted only for the
one file the model names, so a listing call never pays the outline-extraction
cost for files that turn out to be irrelevant.  Keeping outlines out of both
the per-turn prompt and the plain listing is what stops upload metadata from
growing with ``file count x conversation turns``.
