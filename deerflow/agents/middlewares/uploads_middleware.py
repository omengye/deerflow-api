"""Middleware to inject uploaded files information into agent context.

Only files attached to the *current* message get full metadata (size, path, and
document outline).  Files uploaded earlier in the thread are announced as a bare
name list; the model calls ``list_uploaded_files`` to fetch their details on
demand.  Injecting every historical outline on every turn made upload metadata
grow with ``file count x conversation turns``.

The block is injected through ``wrap_model_call`` rather than ``before_agent``
so it never enters the persisted message history.  Writing it back to state (as
this middleware previously did, reusing the message id) checkpointed one block
per turn, so a long thread accumulated many near-duplicate blocks in the
history that the model then had to re-read on every subsequent request.
