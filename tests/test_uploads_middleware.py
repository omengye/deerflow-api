"""Unit tests for the uploads middleware and the ``list_uploaded_files`` tool.

The core regression these guard against: the ``<uploaded_files>`` block used
to be written back into persisted state with the same message id (so
``add_messages`` overwrote it in place), which meant every model call still
re-read every historical file's outline and, worse, a long thread accumulated
one near-duplicate block per turn in the checkpoint. The fix injects the block
through ``wrap_model_call`` (transient, per model call, never persisted) and
lists historical uploads by name only.
